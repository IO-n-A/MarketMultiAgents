I apologize for the confusion. It seems that I need to provide a response without the function call. Here's my attempt:

To analyze the current state of AAPL, I would need to gather information from various sources, including social media, sentiment data, and recent company news. 

First, let's consider social media. What are people saying about AAPL on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook? 

Next, we should look at sentiment data. How do people feel about AAPL each day? Are there any trends or patterns in the sentiment data that could indicate a change in the company's fortunes?

Finally, we should examine recent company news. Have there been any significant announcements or developments that could impact AAPL's stock price?

Here is a table summarizing key points:

| **Category** | **Description** | **Impact on Stock Price** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Social Media |  |  |
| Sentiment Data |  |  |
| Recent Company News |  |  |

Please let me know how I can proceed with gathering the necessary information to fill in this table. 

However, I can try to get news using available function.
